                - The report will contain various categories related to blood with defined values.
                - Determine if each category's value is within the normal range.
                - If the normal range is provided, compare the value to it; otherwise, search the internet to determine if the value is normal for a human.
                - Summarize the report, indicating which categories are normal and which are abnormal.

Thought: Based on the summarized blood report, all values except Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) are within the normal range. I need to find information about the abnormal RDW value and provide health recommendations.

Final Answer: 

Abnormal Finding:
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW): Abnormal (High)
- Value: 15.5%
- Normal Range: 11.5 - 14.5%

Health Recommendation and Supporting Articles:

An elevated RDW value may indicate anemia, a lack of sufficient healthy red blood cells, or a deficiency in nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for further evaluation and appropriate actions.
